# face-verification
* This is a simple project for face recognition and verification using machine learning. <br/>
* The id folder has the photo id of people with a unique ID number as the filename and the webcam folder has the captured face images of the people (5 images each) with their ID number as the filename.
* The images in the webcam folder are compared with the image in the id folder based on the ID number and the results are written in the output.xlsx file weather they match or not against each ID number.
* Here, the face_recognition - a PiPY library is used for recognition and verification process.
